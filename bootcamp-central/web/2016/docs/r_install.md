## How to install R

For simulation we are going to use R, a statistical programming
language. The software is open-source, interacts well with *git*, has
many packages written by and for the bioinformatics community and is
also useful for developing graphics and web app.

We are going to access R via a package called RStudio, which provides
additional resources including a window system which facilitates
installing packages , accessing the help files, and documenting your
work. RStudio is also free.

All of this software is available on Macs, Windows, and Linux. Mostly it
works identically on all types of computers, although I have noticed
that sometimes the versions are out of sync.

To get started, please install R and RStudio as directed below.

### Installing R

1.  Go to <https://www.r-project.org/>

2.  Select a CRAN mirror. (This is the computer that you are downloading
    from. It is advisable to select a mirror that is geographically
    close.)

3.  Select the appropriate version for the type of computer you are
    using.

4.  Install the downloaded software just like any other software on your
    computer.
