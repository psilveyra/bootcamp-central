### Install a text editor

Microsoft Word is **NOT** a text editor. Using Word to edit text will will eventually cause (devious) errors.
Best if you start using a proper text editor. Essential features:

* Ability to show `TAB` characters versus multiple `SPACE` characters.
  Mixing up `TABS` and `SPACES` is a very common error. Copy-pasting from a web
  page often turns a `TAB` into `SPACE` characters (yes, it very annoying!)
  You need the ability to see the difference between these otherwise invisible
  characters if necessary.
* Show line numbering. Allows you to identify the line where an error is reported.
* Switch line endings. Line endings have variants: `Unix`, `Windows` or `Mac OS 9` endings
  (the new `Mac OSX` uses `Unix` line endings). Typically all files should have a  `Unix` line ending mode.
  Your editor needs to have the ability to convert line endings to `Unix` format.

### Recommendations

* [Notepad++][notepadplus] on Windows
* [Sublime Text][sublime] on most other platforms

Personal preference :

* [PyCharm][pycharm] is a Python programming specific
  editor with very powerful features.
