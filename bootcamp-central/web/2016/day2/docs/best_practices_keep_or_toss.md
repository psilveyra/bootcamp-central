### KEEP Rule 1.1 Keep it simple

Simplicity is the most powerful virtue that any process
can have. There is only one problem: it is kind of
difficult to keep it simple

### KEEP Rule 3.1: Small steps with frequent feedback

There is great value in keep the entire pipeline working at most times.
Save often, commit often. Rerun often.

### KEEP Rule 3.3: Version control EVERYTHING

While git was designed for software you should keep everything (other
than large datasets) in it. You get free backup and replication with it!

### TOSS Rule 5.4 Use a symbolic debugger.

There is nothing wrong with print statements.
Symbolic debuggers promote writing complex programs.
If you can't debug a program with simple print
statements your program may be already too complicated.

### TOSS Rule 8.1 Use pre-merge code reviews

This is a concept borrowed from software engineering where
it is assumed that all people on a team work on a the exact same
and relatively simple problem. This rarely happens in sciences.
This rule is one of these "feel good" rules that are just unrealistic in
scientific practice.

### TOSS Rule 8.2 Use pair programming

Pair programming is again a concept borrowed from
software engineering. But it disregards the fact that most
software engineers need to solve
far simpler and far better defined problems than
scientists do. It is sort of a pipe dream that we can do this.
